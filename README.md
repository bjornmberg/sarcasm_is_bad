# Practical Business Applications of Sarcastic Tweet Detection Using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning

I used NLP and machine learning to predict sarcastic tweets and developed a [web app](https://www.thesarcometer.com/) to demonstrate the model. I also tailored the resultant sarcasm model to address three realistic practical business applications. Finally, I explored the model's utility for complementing a sentiment analysis involving a novel dataset, the [sentiment140 data](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140).
